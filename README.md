# Contour-Detection
Contour Detection using Python

This project showcases contour detection using OpenCV and Python. Contour detection is a technique used to find the outline or shape of objects within an image, and it's commonly used in object detection and shape analysis.

In this project, we apply the following steps to detect contours in an image:

- Grayscale Conversion: Converts the image into a simpler form, allowing easier contour detection.
- Binary Thresholding: A threshold is applied to differentiate the foreground (object) from the background.
- Contour Detection: Detects the contours of objects within the image.
- Contour Drawing: The detected contours are drawn on the original image for visual analysis.

The process, from loading and resizing the image to converting it to grayscale, applying binary thresholding, detecting contours, and drawing these contours on the image, is displayed within the Jupyter Notebook using matplotlib.

### Steps Involved:
- Original Image Display: The input image is loaded and resized.
- Grayscale Conversion: The image is converted to grayscale to simplify processing.
- Binary Thresholding: A binary threshold is applied to create a clear distinction between the object and the background.
- Contour Detection: Contours are detected on the thresholded image.
- Contour Drawing: The detected contours are drawn on the original image, highlighting object boundaries.

All images are displayed within the Jupyter Notebook for better visualization of each step.
